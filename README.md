## Mastery-based learning

This repository contains resources for *mastery-based learning* in 
undergraduate computer architecture courses. As principal Danielle
Salzberg has said: [[1]](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/53241/how-mastery-based-learning-can-help-students-of-every-background-succeed)

> Mastery-based learning is a complete paradigm shift for most teachers. It means thinking about grading as a way to provide feedback, and not a random act that we do because the quarter is ending.

Principles of mastery-based learning include: [[2]](https://portal.ct.gov/SDE/Mastery-Based-Learning/10-Principles-of-Mastery-Based-Learning)

* Providing students with learning goals and the objective criteria for measuring them.

* Grading students based on these objective criteria and not on work habits, such as as neatness, timeliness, and effort.

* Giving students multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery, ultimately grading them on *whether*, not *when*, they mastered the material.

These practices place a burden on teachers -- requiring them to create
and grade multiple versions of each test. This repository contains
scripts for generating questions and answers that can be uploaded to
Canvas or other learning management systems for automated testing.
