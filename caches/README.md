### M1 Calculating average memory access times (AMATs)

Sample question:

> A processor has 2 levels of caches. The L1 cache has an access time of 1 cycle and a hit rate of 87%. 
> The L2 cache has an access time of 6 cycles and a cumulative hit rate of 99%. Main memory accesses take 
> 49 cycles. All of the access times are concurrent (done in parallel). What is the average memory access 
> time in cycles? Enter a decimal number.
