These scripts generate problems for computer architecture courses.

## Learning outcomes

### CA1: Converting integers from decimal to binary, octal, and hexadecimal

Sample question:

> The decimal number 91 can be represented as ________ (binary), ___ (octal) and __ (hexadecimal). Please omit leading zeroes.

### CA2a: Converting negative integers from decimal to two's complement

Sample question:

> Convert the decimal number -7 into 8-bit two's complement notation.

### CA2b: Converting negative decimal integers into two's complement

Sample question:

>  Convert the 8-bit two's complement number 11110001 into decimal notation.

### CA3: Ordering two's complement numbers

Sample question:

> The following numbers are in two's complement notation. Please order them from lowest (most negative) to highest (most positive). For example, if they were already correctly ordered, your answer would be ABCD.
>
> A = 00111101
> B = 11100000
> C = 10110101
> D = 00101100
> 
> For full credit, answer the problem without converting all of the numbers to decimal.

### CA4: Converting decimal numbers into IEEE single-precision floating point

Sample question:

> When the number 98.75 is converted to single-precision floating-point format, the sign bit is _, the exponent field holds the eight bits ________, and the first 8 fraction bits are ________.

### CA5: Ordering floating-point numbers

Sample question:

> The following numbers are in single-precision floating point format. Please order them from lowest (most negative) to highest (most positive). For example, if they were already correctly ordered, your answer would be ABCD.
> 
> A = 1 10000011 10100000000000000000000
> B = 0 10000101 00110000000000000000000
> C = 1 10000100 11111000000000000000000
> D = 0 10000010 10100000000000000000000
>
> For full credit, answer the problem without converting all of the numbers to decimal.
