###  DL2. Finding the minimal sum-of-products formula with a 4-input Karnaugh map

Sample question:

> Consider a function F with 4 1-bit inputs A, B, C, and D. We can treat those 4 bits as a number N in the range 0-15 (inclusive), where A is the most significant bit and D is the least significant bit.
>
> Let F(N) be 0 when N is any of [1, 5, 9, 10], and let F(N) be 1 when N is any of [0, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12]. In all other cases, we don't care what the value of F is.
>
> Create a truth table and Karnaugh map for the function F and give the minimal sum-of-products formula. You may put your products in any order, but the terms within them must be alphabetized (e.g., write "A&~B", not "~B&A").
